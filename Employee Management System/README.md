Employee Management System (Abstract Class Demo)

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This mini-project demonstrates the use of Abstraction in Java.
We define an abstract class Employee with an abstract method calculateBonus() and implement it in the subclass Bonus.
The program allows multiple employees to be added, calculates their bonuses based on role, and displays the details neatly.


---

âš™ Features

Uses Abstract Classes and Method Overriding

Supports multiple employees using ArrayList

Calculates bonus based on role:

Developer â†’ 20% of salary

Manager â†’ 30% of salary

Intern â†’ 10% of salary


Validates user input (salary > 0, correct roles only)



---

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Language: Java

Concepts: Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, ArrayList



---

ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Enter the number of employees.


2. For each employee, input:

Position (Developer/Manager/Intern)

Name

ID

Salary



3. The system calculates the bonus based on position.


4. Displays all employee details with salary + bonus.
