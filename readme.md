# Java Mini Projects: Inheritance Demo 🌟

Hey there! 👋

This is a simple Java program I wrote to practice and demonstrate one of the coolest concepts in Object-Oriented Programming — **Inheritance**.

---

## What’s inside? 📦

- A **`Person`** base class with common attributes like name and age.
- A **`Student`** class that inherits from Person and adds `roll number` and `course`.
- A **`Teacher`** class that inherits from Person and adds `subject` and `salary`.
- Input validation to make sure we get sensible data (like age and salary > 0).
- Nice and readable console output separated by dividing lines for clarity.

## Why I made this? 🤔

As a 2nd-year B.Tech student who's been diving into Java for about 30–45 days, I wanted to get hands-on experience with inheritance and input handling. This project really helped me get comfortable with those basics!
